# Mess Menu Manager

This is a simple application built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications, and Pandas for data manipulation. It allows users to manage a mess menu where students can view the menu for 7 days of the week, and managers can update, add, or delete items from the menu.

## Features

- **Two Pages:** The application consists of two pages: one for students to view the menu and another for managers to update the menu.
- **Menu Management:** Managers can add, delete, and update items in the menu.
- **Data Persistence:** The menu data is stored in an Excel file (`menu.xlsx`) for persistence.

## To Run
```
  streamlit run app.py
```
